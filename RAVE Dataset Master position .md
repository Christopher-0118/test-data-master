**What will Dataset Master do?**



Right now ML team spends a lot of time to prepare/process data for/after annotation,  creating configs for Scalabel or any other tool. For this reason sometimes Annotation team experiences difficulties and delays in receiving and processing of datasets if Engineers are involved into their main project. We need some separate position inside Annotation team who will be responsible for all stages of data preparing and processing as it is more effective and cheaper from the side of business processes. Data Master will be full-time engaged in this type of work and won’t be able to annotate/review. It looks possible to find such a person inside the RAVE team as initial knowledge of Python is enough for maintaining Dataset Master responsibilities. The fact that annotators know workflow and types of projects looks like additional pros not to hire a Python software Engineer from outside.



**How will Dataset Master be integrated into the RAVE team?**

Dataset Master will be a separate position inside Annotation team with reporting to Annotation Project Manger ( [@Alesia K]() ) → RAVE Project Manager ( [@Andrei S]() ) → Engineering Manager ( [@Vladislav A]() ). This person will communicate with the Dev team project leads, get tasks from them and will be responsible for timelines and quality of data pre/post processing.



**Skills that we are waiting:**

- Python;
- aws (copy, sync);
- aws + python;
- simple knowledge about opencv (open, crop image, save);
- git;
- ability to learn quickly, responsibility and etc.



**Test tasks for Dataset Master position:**



1. Create your own account in AWS.
2. Create bucket, upload 100 photos (show bash script how to upload and how to show count of images).
3. Annotate images in Scalabel (First, create task for detection for that 100 photos).
4. Download bdd annotation format.
5. Write script how to convert from bdd format to pascal voc and upload that pascal voc annotation to your s3 bucket.

 \6. Send script and screenshots of your local bucket structure to [@Andrei S]() .

**Timeline:** 04/29.
